## About
This project is an independent study project as part of Villanova University's Computer Science Program. This project is an exploration of several technologies new to me: NextJS App Router, Typescript, MySQL, ORM's (Prisma), Bun, TailwindCSS, and Clerk (Authentication). This represents a website for a barbeque restaraunt where users can order from a menu, and the orders will be displayed for the "cooks".

## NextJS
NextJS is a full stack react framework created  by Vercel. The App router is a file based routing system released in Alpha with NextJS 14 in October 2023.

## Typescript
Typescript is type safe Javascript

## MySQL
MySQL is a database management language based on SQL.

## ORMs
ORM stands for Object Relational Model, and they make it easier to use Databases.
